Smart Contract functionality gives Tenants and Landlords a portal to interact with each other remotely but in a more verifiable manner. Smart contracts, in this case, can handle transactions like rent, bills, and security deposits. This makes the agreements clearer, as the conditions surrounding these are recorded on the blockchain ledger.
